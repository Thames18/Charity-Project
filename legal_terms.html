<h3 id="terms">Terms of Service</h3>

<p>This contract is between Liberapay, a non-profit organization founded in 2015
based on French law, hereinafter referred to as “the organization”, and the
person who signs up for its eponymous service, hereinafter referred to as “the
user”.</p>

<h4>1. Nature of the service</h4>

<p>The service is designed to facilitate anonymous, recurrent, monetary donations
between its users.</p>

<p>The service normally allows the user to increase the visibility of its profile
in various way, but the organization reserves the right to disable the user&#39;s
access to those features.</p>

<p>The user agrees not to use the service for financial transactions that are not
donations, notably those linked to the execution of a contract or a promise of
recompense.</p>

<h4>2. Pricing</h4>

<p>The service is free. The user is invited to participate in its funding, through
the service itself, by donating to the natural and legal persons that maintain
it.</p>

<h4>3. Management of the funds</h4>

<p>The organization guarantees that the funds the user has put in its custody will
not be lost in case of bankruptcy of itself or of a third party to whom it has
delegated the custody of the funds.</p>

<p>The organization pledges to correct any mistake on its part in the execution of
the donations.</p>

<p>The organization does not guarantee that the user will be able to withdraw the
money in its account without delay. In particular, the organization may impose a
delay to deter and protect itself from fraud.</p>

<h4>4. Honesty</h4>

<p>The user commits to use the service in good faith, in particular the user
commits not to lie about their identity and not to fill their profile in a
deceptive way for the purpose of attracting more donations.</p>

<h4>5. Reimbursements</h4>

<p>The user commits to reimburse a donation received if it is revealed that its
origin is fraudulent.</p>

<p>Neither the user nor the organization commit to the reimbursement of a donation
following a request with no solid legal or contractual basis.</p>

<h4>6. Intellectual property</h4>

<p>When the user transmits to the service a copyrighted content, it authorizes the
organization to store, copy, translate, and publish it. By doing so the user
declares that they hold the rights necessary to grant this licence.</p>

<h4>7. Termination of service</h4>

<p>The user can quit the service by closing their account. Doing so does not negate
the responsibility of the user for the period during which they used the
service.</p>

<p>The organization may close the user&#39;s account if it considers that they have
violated this contract, or a contract with a partner of the organization, or any
applicable law.</p>

<h4>8. Disclaimers</h4>

<p>The only commitments made by the organization in this contract are those that
are explicitly listed in it. The organization does not implicitly commit to
anything, in particular it does not guarantee that the service will be
operational at all times without interruptions.</p>

<p>The organization cannot be held responsible for the consequences of negligence
by the user, notably of failure by the user to secure their password.</p>

<p>The organization does not assume any of the user&#39;s responsibilities. Notably,
the user is responsible for the declaration of any income received through the
service to the competent authorities and to pay any applicable taxes.</p>

<p>The organization is not responsible in case of dispute between a donor and a
donee when it only acted as an intermediary between them.</p>

<h4>9. Modifications</h4>

<p>The organization may modify this contract at any time. It undertakes to inform
the user of any changes. By continuing to use the service, the user tacitly
accepts the new conditions. If the user refuses the new conditions, then they
must close their account.</p>

<h4>10. Jurisdiction</h4>

<p>This contract is subject to French law. Any dispute shall be submitted to the
competent French jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This document is a translation provided for your convenience, the actual binding
contract is the original version written in French.</p>

<p>If a part of this contract is nullified, that judgment does not nullify the rest
of the agreement.</p>

<h4>11. Cookies</h4>

<p>The user acknowledges that cookies are necessary for the service to function and
agrees to their use.</p>


<h3 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We do our best to protect everyone&#39;s privacy: we do not attempt to track people who visit our website, we strive to collect only the personal information we actually need, and we don&#39;t sell it to anyone.</p>
